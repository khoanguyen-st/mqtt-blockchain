What information will be stored for digital asset on blockchain 


When a digital asset (such as a building, equipment, or energy project) is tokenized and stored on a blockchain, the information recorded can be grouped into three key layers:


🧩 1. Asset Metadata (Descriptive Information)


This describes what the asset is, similar to a digital “identity card” for the real-world object.


Typical data fields:


Asset ID / Token ID: Unique identifier for the asset (e.g., VEEP-HCMC-CHILLER-001).


Asset Type: e.g., building, solar panel, chiller, battery, carbon offset project.


Owner / Issuer Address: Blockchain wallet of the legal owner or operator.


Creation Date & Tokenization Source: Who and when tokenized the asset.


Physical Location: GPS coordinates, address, or geohash (for spatial mapping).


Specifications: Equipment capacity, model number, manufacturer, commissioning date.


Lifecycle Status: Active, under maintenance, decommissioned, retired.


For buildings or energy systems, metadata can also include:


Floor area, building type, energy baseline, system components, etc.


🔗 2. Performance & Verification Data (Operational Layer)


This layer links the real-world performance to the digital asset using IoT, M&V, and audit records — essential for ESG, carbon credit, or performance-based contracts.


Typical data fields:


IoT Sensor / Meter IDs: LoRaWAN, Modbus, or BACnet device IDs linked to the asset.


Time-series Data Hashes: Energy consumption, temperature, occupancy, etc., hashed and stored (actual data may reside off-chain in IPFS or a data lake).


Baseline & Savings Data: For IPMVP-compliant measurement and verification (M&V).


Carbon Offset Calculations: e.g., “2,150 tCO₂e saved as of 2025-09-30.”


Third-party Verification Record: Reference to Verra, Gold Standard, or auditor signature.


Smart Contract Execution: Energy-savings payout, carbon-credit minting, etc.


🪙 3. Financial & Ownership Layer


This layer supports token economics, traceability, and trading.


Typical data fields:


Token Standard: ERC-721 (unique NFT), ERC-1155 (fractional ownership), or SPL (Solana token).


Fractional Ownership Records: e.g., 1,000 units represent 1 MWh/year efficiency yield.


Transaction History: All transfers, staking, or sales recorded immutably.


Valuation & Yield Data: Energy savings, ROI, carbon credit value.


Regulatory Compliance Tag: CSRD, JCM, or ISO reference.


🌐 4. Optional: Off-chain References (Linked Data)


Since blockchains can’t store heavy data, links to external verified datasets are often added:


IPFS / Arweave Links: Store PDFs of M&V reports, building drawings, audit certificates.


Digital Twin URL: 3D model or dashboard reference.


ESG or Carbon Registry Link: Thallo, Verra, KlimaDAO, or C3 registry entry.


🧠 Example (for a building energy retrofit project)

What information will a lender or investor look for in an on chain digital asset?


Excellent question — and very relevant if you’re building Energy Efficiency-as-a-Service (EEaaS) or tokenized ESG / carbon credit assets on blockchain (like what you’re doing with VEEP and Solana).


When a lender or investor evaluates an on-chain digital asset, they don’t just look at the token itself — they assess how transparently and credibly the on-chain data reflects real-world performance, risk, and return.


Below is a comprehensive framework of what they will look for — divided into 5 key categories 👇


🧩 1. Asset Identity & Provenance


Investors want to confirm that the tokenized asset truly exists, is unique, and is legally owned.


They will check:


✅ Asset provenance: Digital signature of issuer, proof of original token minting, date, and chain of custody.


✅ Legal ownership record: On-chain wallet linked to verified KYC entity or SPV (special purpose vehicle).


✅ Asset metadata integrity: Model, location, commissioning date, equipment specs.


✅ Off-chain validation: Link to M&V certificate, project registration ID (e.g., Verra, JCM, or LEED).


✅ Immutability: Whether historical ownership and verification data can be publicly verified.


Example:
A token for “VEEP-HCMC-Building-001” has an IPFS hash pointing to the baseline audit, and Solana smart contract confirms it was minted by “VEEP Energy Efficiency Fund SPV”.


📊 2. Performance & Yield Transparency


Investors assess how the asset performs, how reliable the data is, and whether returns are sustainable.


They will look for:


⚡ Real-time or periodic IoT performance data: Energy savings (kWh), emissions avoided (tCO₂e), uptime, etc.


📈 Baseline & M&V data: IPMVP-compliant methodology, pre- vs. post-retrofit baselines.


🧾 Auditor or third-party verification: Timestamped digital signature from accredited verifier.


⛓️ Data immutability proof: Hash of each M&V report stored on-chain.


💡 Smart contract triggers: Automatic reward payout or carbon credit minting once KPIs are met.


Why it matters:
Investors will not finance what they can’t verify. A credible performance trail lowers perceived risk and improves asset rating.


💰 3. Financial Structure & Token Economics


They need to understand how the token produces financial yield and whether it fits their risk-return appetite.


Key checks:


💵 Underlying cash flow: Energy savings, rental payments, carbon credit sale, service fees.


🪙 Token standard & supply: ERC-20/SPL fungible token or ERC-721 NFT; total supply and allocation.


🧾 Revenue distribution logic: Smart contract payout to token holders, reinvestment rules, fee structure.


📊 Valuation basis: Net Present Value (NPV) of expected energy savings or credit yield.


🔐 Escrow or collateral: Whether revenue is secured by receivables or guarantees.
⚖️ Risk mitigation: Performance insurance, service contract guarantees, or blended-finance guarantees (e.g., by Clime Capital or MDB).


Example:
Each “AMIGO Energy Token” represents 1 MWh verified savings = USD 120/year yield; payout managed via smart contract to investors every quarter.


🏦 4. Creditworthiness & Counterparty Risk


A lender (especially in structured finance) needs assurance that the borrower/project operator is reliable.


They will check:


🧍‍♂️ Borrower identity: Verified KYC of asset owner, SPV, or performance contractor.


🏗️ Operational track record: Past projects, O&M history, uptime reliability.


🧾 Debt coverage ratio: Projected DSCR or IRR based on digital cash flow.


💼 Collateralization: Is the tokenized asset pledged as collateral? Is it enforceable legally?


⚙️ Smart contract escrow: To ensure automatic repayment or dividend routing.


📜 Regulatory compliance: CSRD, taxonomy alignment, or ESG disclosure compliance.


🌍 5. ESG & Carbon Credibility


Especially for climate-tech and green-finance investors, the environmental integrity of on-chain data is essential.


They will check:


🌱 Emission factor & baseline reference: Verified by IPMVP or ISO 14064/14067.


🔗 Carbon registry linkage: Verra, Gold Standard, or Thallo/ Solana registry ID.


♻️ Double-counting prevention: Unique serial number for each credit.


🪪 ESG scorecard: Alignment with SDG 7, 9, 13; transparent reporting format.


🧠 AI/IoT integration proof: LoRaWAN or DePIN data confirming actual operational savings.


Example:
A “Green Cooling Token” backed by VOXCOOL cold battery system includes:


Verra MRV report hash


LoRaWAN data hash proving daily kWh offset


CSRD/ESG JSON report published quarterly.
