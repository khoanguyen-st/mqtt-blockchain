## Executive Summary

### What This Integration Adds

**Current State (Bridge Service):**

```
IoT Devices → MQTT → Batching → PostgreSQL → API
```

**After Solana Integration:**

```
IoT Devices → MQTT → Batching → PostgreSQL → API
                                     ↓
                              Solana Blockchain
                                     ↓
                           Customer Verification
```

**Key Benefits:**

- Immutable proof of data integrity
- Customer can independently verify data
- Competitive advantage vs traditional IoT solutions
- Transparent, trustless verification

**Key Metrics:**

- Cost: ~$2-3/day ($60-90/month)
- Time to implement: 4 weeks
- Transaction confirmation: < 60 seconds
- Success rate target: 95%+

| **Total One-Time**           | **$77-105** |                |          |

### Monthly Recurring Costs

| Item              | Cost/Month | Notes                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Transaction fees  | $60-90     | Based on 8,640 batches/day                |
| RPC service       | $0         | Using free public RPC (can upgrade later) |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

**1. Solana Network Outage**

- **Probability:** Medium (has happened before)
- **Impact:** Medium (data still saved to DB)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Retry queue handles outages
  - Service continues operating
  - Automatic retry when network recovers
- **Contingency:** Document to customers that blockchain verification may be delayed

**2. Private Key Compromise**

- **Probability:** Low (with proper security)
- **Impact:** Critical (wallet could be drained)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Secure storage (password manager)
  - No logging of private key
  - Access control
  - Regular security audits
- **Contingency:**
  - Generate new wallet
  - Transfer remaining funds
  - Update configuration
  - Investigate breach

**3. Unexpected High Costs**

- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (budget overrun)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Daily cost monitoring
  - Alerts at $5/day threshold
  - Can disable if needed
- **Contingency:**
  - Increase batch size to reduce transactions
  - Switch to checkpoint approach
  - Budget adjustment

**4. Integration Bugs**

- **Probability:** Medium (new integration)
- **Impact:** Low-Medium (data still safe in DB)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Thorough testing on devnet
  - Gradual rollout
  - Monitoring
- **Contingency:**
  - Rollback capability
  - Fix in subsequent release

### Medium-Priority Risks

**5. Customer Confusion**

- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Low (support burden)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clear documentation
  - Simple verification portal
  - Customer education materials
- **Contingency:** Enhanced support docs

**6. Team Knowledge Gap**

- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (delays)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Training before start
  - Documentation references
  - External expert consultation (if needed)
- **Contingency:** Extend timeline
